# CODE-TASK ACCORDING TO BELOW REQUIREMENTS üìù

The task is to create a simple MVVM project in kotlin and compose that should have all tasks below

1) A simple login screen. ( you can allow anyone to log in, no validation needed)

2) Once you login, greet the user based on the time of the day (show a textbox displaying the message and the username/email which the user entered)

3) On the same page,  display the name , dose and strength of medicine shown in the json below : (add them as cards in a recyclerview)

https://pastebin.com/jKVv22p8 ( use mocky.io to create mock api  if you'd like or to extend the existing api). Tapping on each of these cards, will open a detailed view showing the same data.(please use just 1 model class for this and keep code as consistent as possible)

4) Use room DB to store any data.

5) Write at least 3 unit tests for any use cases that apply.
